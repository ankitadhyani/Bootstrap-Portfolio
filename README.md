# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Created my Portfolio using CSS-Bootstrap feature

There are 3 html pages in this portfolio

1. index.html
    "index.htm" acts like the home page to the web-site, from where user can navigate to Portfolio and Contact pages

2. portfolio.html
    This file contains the projects I have been part of in my career. Basically the projects have been categorized into 3:-
    2.1. Intership Projects
    2.2. Volunteer work
    2.3. Full Time work experience

    NOTE: The image links do not work as of now will be developed later.

3. contact.html
    This page contains my contact card and links to social sites like my LinkedIn profile, GitHub profile, gmail and Facebook page.

    NOTE: Images are added but links to the respective sites have not been included yet.
